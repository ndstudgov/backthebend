# Back the Bend
This is the website repository for the [Back the Bend website](backthebend.nd.edu).

# Resources
  * [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
  * [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
  * [json](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/index.htm)
  
# Using middleman
  * When developing locally, use `middleman build` to create the full html version of the ruby site.
  * Then use `middleman server` to locally serve the website. Middleman will tell you which port of your computer to view it on.
  * Finally, when all the changes have been pushed to the github, use `middleman deploy` to make the changes live on the site. 

# Editing/creating a project
  * Make edits in the `data/projects.json` file.
  * Make sure to keep the formatting consistent with other entries.
  * Push these changes to github.
  
# Images
  * All images are in the `source/images` folder
  * Store all images for organization logos in the `logo_images` subfolder.
  * Store all images for project images in the `project_images` subfolder.
  * Double check the image extension is correct! (.jpg, .png, etc.)
  * Make sure to push all new images to the github.
